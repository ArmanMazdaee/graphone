# Vision
Graphone is a community project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:
A wrapper around graphql and typeorm to make backend development easy again

Our detailed items:
  * Easy to define actions for schema
* Generating GraphQL schema from TypeORM entities

## Core Concept
Graphone is based on the idea of simplifying backend and providing an easy to use API

## General Aim
Our aim is to make backend development easy again by providing a set of tools to interact with GraphQL and TypeORM in an easier way

## Communication
A lot of discussion about Graphone happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until Graphone becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The Graphone project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
